  // Heuristics for deciding if a flag is experimental:
  // - there are known bugs most people will encounter and that block being
  // able to use Gatsby normally
  // - very few people have tested the feature so we're not sure if we've
  // uncovered even common problems.
  //
  // Flags should start as experimental but once all serious known bugs are
  // resolved and ~50+ people have tested it, experimental should be set to
  // false.
  experimental: boolean
  // Generally just return true.
  //
  // False means it'll be disabled despite the user setting it true e.g.
  // it just won't work e.g. odn't have new enough version for something.
  // We warn in this case.
  //
  // OPT_IN means the gatsby will enable the flag (unless the user explicitly
  // disablees it.
